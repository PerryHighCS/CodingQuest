## CodingQuest Starter Project
A simple project with starter code for a year of [CodingQuest](https://codingquest.io/), a worldwide competition for High School students and a great preparation for the AP Computer Science A test.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE
3. Find the `src` folder and open the `Day01.java` file.
   - This is the starter code for the first day of the competition. Each day has a separate file. Use the `solve` method to solve the day's problem from [CodingQuest](https://codingquest.io/).
   - Each day also has an input file in the input folder (eg `input01.txt` for `Day01.java`). After reading the day's challenge on [CodingQuest](https://codingquest.io/), copy the input into the day's input file.
4. Run the Day01.java file to test your solution.
